# Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Overview of Projectt

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning techiniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes with respect to credit card risk since high-quality loans outnumber risky loans. We use RandomOverSampler, SMOTE Oversampling, ClussterCentroids Undersampling, SMOEENN Combination, BalanceRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict credit risk.
